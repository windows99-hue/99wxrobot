# 99 WeChat Bot
## [English Version](https://github.com/windows99-hue/99wxrobot/blob/main/readme-en.md)

This program can automatically detect user messages and provide responses, operating fully autonomously.

## Installation

Download the source code or clone this repository.

Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

<span style="color: red;">AttentionÔºö</span>If you believe this installation might conflict with libraries you already have installed, I recommend creating a virtual environment. [Tutorial here](https://chat.openai.com/c/venv.md).

## Usage

### Running the Project:

```
bashCopy code
python main-normal.py
```

Please execute this command in your terminal. 99 WeChat Bot is a command-line program, so it's recommended to run it in a terminal. Configure your bot according to your preferences, and press the Backspace key to close the bot.

### Customizing the Bot

```python
help_text = ''' 
Hello there! The master is currently away, and I'm here to take over. üòä
To leave a message for the master, simply prefix your message with "ÁïôË®Ä:" or "yly".
Your message will be sent directly to the master's phone.
To turn the bot on or off, simply type "ÂÖ≥Èó≠" or "ÊâìÂºÄ" (close/open).
You can also type "Â∏ÆÂä©" or "help" to access more usage instructions.
Feel free to chat with me directly!
Wishing you a wonderful day! üòÑ
'''
```

The `help_text` variable is the response when the bot receives its first message.
<span style="color: red;">Note:</span>Please enter `/n` at the line break. This is not an incorrect line break, but a parsing symbol for program specific line breaks.

```python
more_help_text = '''
Additional tips include: 
- "Â§©Ê∞î," "‰ªäÊó•Â§©Ê∞î," or "weather" to check the current weather.
  You can specify a location by adding a space and the location.
- "60Áßí," "ÂÖ≠ÂçÅÁßí," "day60s," or "‰ªäÊó•Êñ∞Èóª" to get the "ÊØèÊó•60Áßí" image.
'''
```

This is the content that will be displayed when a user sends the "help" command to the bot.

### Plugins

To add your own plugins, place them in the "plugin" folder and import them into the main file. In the loop where unread messages are checked, add `elif` statements to handle different messages. The `last_msg` variable holds the user's last message, which you can use to formulate responses.

### Version Information

- `main-v0.5.py` is the initial version of the bot but contains numerous bugs. It is not recommended for modification or use.
- `main-low.py` is a historical version that did not handle `@` requests correctly.
- `main-v1.5.py` is a historical version that correctly handled `@` requests and is lightweight and customizable.
- `main-normal.py` is the current and highly functional version of the bot.

## Features
